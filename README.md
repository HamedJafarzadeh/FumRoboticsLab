# FUM Robotics Lab Website
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5dcf680c-079e-400e-bfca-e7ac300ef644/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/upbeat-bell-6683dd/deploys)

This is the main repository for [www.fumrobotics.ir](https://fumrobotics.ir) website. This website is built up on NuxtJS and Vue JS Framework. It is generated as a fully static website.

[Netlify](www.netlify.com) is used for building and automatic deployment of the website. The ***deploy*** branch is used for final deployment.

This website and repository is open for editing and contribution, in order to change or update the contents, 
you can simply fork the repository, change it and submit a merge request. I will try to merge it as soon as possible.

You can also clone or download the repository on your local computer and edit it. 

I suggest to use WebStorm IDE for editing the contents and pages.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
