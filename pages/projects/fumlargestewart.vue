          A Stewart platform is a type of parallel manipulator that has six prismatic actuators enabling 6-DoF, commonly hydraulic jacks or electric linear actuators, attached in pairs to three positions on the platform's baseplate, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. All 12 connections are made via universal joints. Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move: three linear movements x, y, z (lateral, longitudinal, and vertical), and the three rotations (pitch, roll, and yaw).
          The Stewart platform design is extensively used in motion simulators, such as in the full flight simulator which requires all 6 degrees of freedom.
          FUM ROBOTICS LAB has developed a high payload and high-speed Stewart robot with 2200Kg payload capacity as a motion platform which can be equipped with pneumatic weight support system.
