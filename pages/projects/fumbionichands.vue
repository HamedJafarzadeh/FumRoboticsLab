          Bionics or biologically inspired engineering is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. A prosthesis is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth. Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part, making it easier to perform activities of daily living such as eating, tying shoelaces, carrying bags, opening doors, switching on lights, typing, and more.
          Partial hand loss comprises about 90 percent of all upper extremity amputations and may involve the loss of one or more digits. Prosthetic hands provide functionality, mobility, and confidence to amputees. With these devices designed to help retain the function and appearance of a regular hand, those with full or partial hand loss can overcome trauma, aiding them leading full lives. Basic prosthetic hands are cosmetic replicas with only basic function, whereas powered prosthetic hands have a set of fully articulated joints.

          FUM Bionic hand is designed for individuals with loss of hand to perform everyday activities with ease. Individual motors in each finger allow using natural, coordinated grasp patterns. As an articulating, body-driven prosthesis, the designed device restores length, provides dexterity, replaces a missing hand, designed and fabricated to successfully mimic the complex motion of a finger. This prototype facilitates 5 Degrees of Freedom, allowing independent finger control. Actuators are placed at the palm of the hand, providing the ability to conform to the shape of different objects. EMG signals are utilized for activation of the hand.
