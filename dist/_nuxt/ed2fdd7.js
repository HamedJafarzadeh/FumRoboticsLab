Each year millions of patients are infected, and thousands of patients die due to infections acquired during hospitalization. Furthermore, HAIs generate a massive financial implication.\n        UV light, which is ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths between 200 and 290 nm, has been proven to be effective in breaking down the pathogens’ DNA and RNA beyond recovery, thus stopping them from replicating.\n        The UVD Robot is used as part of the regular cleaning cycle, and aims at preventing and reducing the spread of infectious diseases, viruses, bacteria, and other types of harmful organic micro-organisms in the environment by breaking down their DNA-structure. This robot is a supplementary device which assists the cleaning staff. The collaborative robot can be used in various enclosed spaces – not only in hospitals. The technology also works in environments such as office spaces, shopping malls, schools, airports and production facilities.\n        However, are mostly not designed to work with humans in the room. Their bulky size makes it difficult to navigate crowded spaces and reach shadowy areas. They blast light that can be dangerous to humans in large doses, requiring rooms to be vacated for the safety of healthcare workers or patients since exposure to the light can be harmful, causing sunburn, eye damage, and even skin cancer.\n      ")])]),e._v(" "),r("br"),e._v(" "),r("br"),e._v(" "),r("br")])])}],o={name:"fumvirub3036"},c=n(48),component=Object(c.a)(o,(function(){var e=this.$createElement;this._self._c;return this._m(0)}),r,!1,null,"c86544ce",null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
