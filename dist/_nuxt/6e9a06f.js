When a robot works in a structured environment, its automation is easier than in a non-structured environment in which case its modeling is quite difficult and presents a high computational effort. To overcome this difficulty, series elastic actuator (SEA) has been applied in compliant robotic grasping. Unlike rigid actuators, a SEA contains an elastic element in series with the mechanical energy source. Such an elastic element gives SEAs tolerance to impact loads, low mechanical output impedance, passive mechanical energy storage, and increased peak power output. The spring has to be able to support the loads, but it cannot be too stiff; otherwise, system impedance will be high.\n      ")])]),t._v(" "),r("br"),t._v(" "),r("br"),t._v(" "),r("br")])])}],o={name:"fumlinearSEA"},c=n(48),component=Object(c.a)(o,(function(){var t=this.$createElement;this._self._c;return this._m(0)}),r,!1,null,"19990616",null);e.default=component.exports}}]);
