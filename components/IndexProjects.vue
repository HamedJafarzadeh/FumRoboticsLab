        a hard, laminated plastic shell that provides the weight-bearing support. Most countries report a rapid increase in ageing population worldwide. Elderly people normally have physical deterioration and frailty, imposing a heavy burden on the social health care system. In addition, each year, approximately 15 million people suffer from a stroke worldwide and 5 million of these individuals are left with a permanent disability.

        In this regard, an increasing trend has emerged in using robots for medical purposes. Rehabilitative robotics is an area in the interface of medical and engineering fields, with a variety of different robotic applications, one of which is the use of robotic exoskeleton in rehabilitation.

        Knee rehabilitation enabling game based therapy One specific area in medical robotics is joint rehabilitation. Knee rehabilitation therapy is a very important procedure to recover function after knee injury or surgery. The treatment objective is to reduce knee adhesion and regain adequate joint motion and flexibility. The key to successful knee rehabilitation requires regular exercises in a very controlled manner. Along this lines, 1DOF Lower-limb rehabilitation robot has been designed and constructed at FUM Robotics lab. Capable of using EMG signals, a variety of cognitive games can be employed and integrated with the system to assist the therapist in adjusting the rehabilitation process according to the medical progress of the user.

        Biologically inspired hand with articulated finger motion  Bionics or biologically inspired engineering is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. A prosthesis is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth. Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part, making it easier to perform activities of daily living such as eating, tying shoelaces, carrying bags, opening doors, switching on lights, typing, and more.

      <IndexProjectItem :is-right="true" project-name="FUM Industrial SCARA Robot"  project-subtitle="" project-link="/fumindustrialscara" project-picture="scara.png">
        Industrial grade SCARA arm SCARA is an acronym for Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm, meaning it is relatively compliant in the X-Y axis, and rigid in the Z-axis. SCARA robots were designed to mimic the action of a human arm to automate assembly or loading and unloading tasks with speed and precision. This feature allows the arm to extend into confined areas and then retract or "fold up" out of the way. This is advantageous for transferring parts from one cell to another or for loading/ unloading process stations that are enclosed. The idea is to get all the benefit of a human employee at a higher speed and without fatigue. Adding one or more SCARA robots to the production line is one of the more affordable ways to increase production speed and deliver payback on your automation investment

      <IndexProjectItem :is-right="false" project-name="FUM Linear SEA"  project-subtitle="" project-link="/fumlinearSEA" project-picture="LA.png" >
        Linear series elastic actuator with high impact tolerance In general, actuators are built to be as stiff as possible to increase the bandwidth. When a robot works in a structured environment, its automation is easier than in a non-structured environment in which case its modeling is quite difficult and presents a high computational effort. To overcome this difficulty, series elastic actuator (SEA) has been applied in compliant robotic grasping. Unlike rigid actuators, a SEA contains an elastic element in series with the mechanical energy source. Such an elastic element gives SEAs tolerance to impact loads, low mechanical output impedance, passive mechanical energy storage, and increased peak power output. The spring has to be able to support the loads, but it cannot be too stiff; otherwise, system impedance will be high.
